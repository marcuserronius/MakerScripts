# MakerScripts
_Inkscape Extensions for Makers_
## Purpose
This project is meant to collect various filters and generators for Inkscape that will be useful to makers, with a focus on laser cutting and 3D printing. There are other libraries out there that do many of these things, but hopefully this will stand out as having a tight subject focus, as well as allowing precise control over the generated paths.
## Installation
Download the zip file and unzip into your Inkscape extensions directory. To find the extensions directory, open Inkscape preferences, choose "System" from the sidebar, then find the entry for "User extensions" and click the "Open" button next to it to open it in your file browser.
## Capabilities
Currently, MakerScripts can generate four different 1D flex cut patterns, which bend in one direction are often used for living hinges or rounded corners on laser cut items. It can also generate two different 2D flex cut patterns, which bend in both directions, and can be used to create arbitrarily curved surfaces.
## Future Plans
There are a number of things being considered for inclusion in future releases:
1. Flex cut push-buttons
2. OpenSCAD export for 2d extrusions
3. Finger joints / Box joints
4. Non-linear flex cut surfaces, such as cones or spheres
